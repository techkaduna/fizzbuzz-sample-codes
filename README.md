Challenge: “Write a program that outputs the FizzBuzz numbers starting at (start) till (_range) as normal. start is a user input of what number to start from while _range is another user input for the range of numbers. In addition if the number is divisible by both by 3 and 5 the output should be ‘FizzBuzz’ . I also advise you use more advanced programming methods like switch statements and ternary operators. “
